			<h4>PRIVACY SUMMARY</h4>
	    <p>None of our products record or sell your personal identifying information. All personal information is stored on-device for personalization purposes only. The only things sent to our backends are anonymous data like analytics and user-inputted usernames and configuration.</p>
	    <h4>GOOGLE ACCOUNTS</h4>
      <p>On our apps with Google Oauth, we only take your email, name, and profile picture. None of that data is sent to or store in our backend. It might be stored locally.</p>
  	  <h4>DISCORD BOTS</h4>
      <p>Our Discord bots store server names and their config files, as well as messages flagged by meese detection along with the author's username for debug purposes only. No other user information or activity is stored, and what is stored is accessible to the JCWYT team only. If you have any questions about data storage, email us at <a href="mailto:info@jcwyt.com">info@jcwyt.com</a>.</p> 
  	  <h4>LEADERBOARDS</h4>
      <p>Our leaderboards are stored through <a target="_blank" href="https://lootlocker.io">LootLocker</a>. Anything you enter as your name can and most likely will be displayed on the public leaderboard. We do our best to censor offensive language. That being said, it is all user-added data and we don't take responsibity for any harm leaderboard names may cause. If you see a name and want to report it, let us know at <a href="mailto:bugs@jcwyt.com">bugs@jcwyt.com</a>.</p> 
  	  <h4>ANALYTICS</h4>
      <p>We take analytic data on most of our websites through Google Analytics, which includes city and device information. That data is not tied to your IP or name.</p>
